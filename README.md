# Exquisite-sketches

Carisa P. Antariksa, Georgina Yeboah

Exquisite Sketches is a collaborative piece that involves digital sketching and assembly. Users are tasked to draw a specific body part prompted on their canvas with their smartphones and assemble their drawn sketch with others. The concept is to take something that can be intricately created using a variety of materials into something as simple as using your finger to draw on your smartphone browser for a fun activity. Gather a group and open the links on your phone browsers to play!
